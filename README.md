# 📘 Day 1 — The Journey Begins

🎯 **First goal:** Learn the basics of statistics — the language behind data.  
Tiny steps today, but every journey begins with them.

### 📚 Today I learned:
- ✔️ The **mean** (arithmetic average)
- ✔️ The **median**, **percentiles**, and **quartiles**  
- ✔️ **Outliers** — the unexpected or extreme values  
- ✔️ The **minimum** and **maximum**

It’s a small beginning, but every bit matters.  
Onward. 🚀
